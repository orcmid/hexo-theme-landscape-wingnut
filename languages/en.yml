#         archive: $HexoSpanner/themes/landscape/languages/en.yml
#          
#         This file is a derivative of the languages/default.yml file
#         provided as part of the Hexo install default landscape theme.

#                           ENGLISH-LANGUAGE LABELS
#                           -----------------------
#
#    These are the English text to be used on English (en) pages, for the
#    identified labels.  
#    
#    This duplicates the current default.yml language entry.  It is replicated
#    in an explicit en.yml file to avoid an error in default determination in
#    the initially-installed Hexo setup.
#
#    Changes to these definitions should also be reflected in default.yml.

# TODO:
#  * Changes to this page needs to be reflected in the English default.yml
#    and synchronization maintained.
#  * Find out how Home, Archive, and About are localized.
#  * Determine how additions are made here, and what is done in other theme
#    and base materials to make use of them.

# 0.0.0 2017-10-29-13:07 copy the 2017-10-25 initially-installed languages/
